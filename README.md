# Eye-Blink-Frequency-Analysis
## ABSTRACT
 The Paralyzed Patients suffering from diseases like Motor Neuron Disease & Locked-in
 Syndrome. Paralyzed Patients cannot communicate with others because the patients are suffer
 from Speech Disorder, the only part that remains unaffected is eyes and communication is
 possible only through their Eye Movements. OpenCV is a Library which is used to carry out
 image processing with Deep Learning by using programming language like python. Face
 Detection is a very important part of the developed eye-blink detection algorithm. The proposed
 application intends on counting the no. of blinks/passing the message of a patient incapable of
 Movements, a camera will be set up in front of the patients face which will capture his face at all
 times and the system analysis the no. of intentional blinks at once where in each number of blinks
 are assigned to controller that gives different outputs depending on the database. The motivation
 for this research is the need for disabled people to communicate with others.
